# Kaggle-Survey-Analysis


## Installations
For my analysis, I used Python and the following library versions: <br>
* pandas version:  0.25.1 <br>
* matplotlib version:  3.0.3 <br>
* seaborn version 0.9.0 <br>

## Project Motivation
I'm currently trying to break into the field of data science, and would like to make sure that I'm practicing the skills most frequently used by data scientists today. <br>

To ensure that I am practing the right skills, I will investigate several of the answers given by data scientists to Kaggle's 2020 Machine Learning and Data Science survey. 

## File Descriptions
* what_skills_are_required.ipynb -- My analysis of the survey. Here I investigate several of the questions answered on the survey. <br>

* kaggle_survey_2020_responses.csv -- The responses to the survey. To get access to this file, go to https://www.kaggle.com/c/kaggle-survey-2020, and accept the rules of the competition.
